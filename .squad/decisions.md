## Session 2026-03-02T0848 Pre-commit Fix

**Resolved:** 3 decisions (CORS, meal plan skip, pre-commit.ci)

### Decision 1: CORS Middleware Config is Correct — No Changes Needed

**Author:** Ripley (Backend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-03-02  
**Status:** Verified

CORS middleware ordering is correct. The `nullslast()` 500 error was the blocker; now fixed in commit `eddc914`. Monitor next pipeline run to confirm E2E CORS tests pass.

### Decision 2: E2E Test Approach for Skipped Tests

**Author:** Dallas (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-03-02  
**Status:** Decided

**CORS/500 problem (5 tests):** `nullslast()` fix resolves. No defensive CORS config needed.

**Meal plan draft problem (7 tests):** Accept skip in preview for MVP. Azure OpenAI not configured in preview — seeding complexity outweighs MVP value. Tests have graceful skip logic. Post-MVP: add `POST /api/v1/test/seed-meal-plan` endpoint for full coverage.

**Pre-commit.ci blocker:** Changed `typescript` → `ts` in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` line 14.

**Expected outcome:** 29 pass, 7 skip, 0 fail. PR status ✅.

### Decision 3: Extend Seed Data to Unblock Meal Plan Tests

**Author:** Lambert (Tester)  
**Date:** 2026-03-02  
**Status:** Superseded by Decision 2

Proposed pre-seeding completed meal plan. Dallas's analysis determined this unnecessary for MVP; accept graceful skips instead. Can revisit post-MVP with test endpoint approach.
